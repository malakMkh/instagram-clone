## Redux Practice

This Instagram Clone emphasizes the practice of Redux for state management. Key Redux concepts and practices include:

- Actions: Actions are dispatched to trigger changes in the application state, such as liking a post or adding a comment.
- Reducers: Reducers specify how the state changes in response to dispatched actions.
- Store: The Redux store holds the application state and enables access to it from any component.
- Dispatch: The `useDispatch` hook is used to dispatch actions from components.
- Selectors: The `useSelector` hook is used to access specific state data in components.
